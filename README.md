# Loan Eligibility Predictor üöÄ

This project predicts whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details like age, income, education, and credit score. It uses machine learning models ‚Äî Logistic Regression and Random Forest ‚Äî and evaluates performance using ROC curves and confusion matrices.

## üìå Problem Statement

Banks want to determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The objective is to build a classification model that can make this decision based on historical applicant data.

---

## üéØ Objective

To develop a machine learning model that:
- Takes applicant features (age, income, education, credit score)
- Predicts if a loan should be **approved** or **rejected**
- Can be used in fintech apps or loan assessment systems

| Feature         | Description                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `age`           | Applicant's age                        |
| `income`        | Applicant's income                     |
| `education`     | Graduate / Not Graduate                |
| `credit_score`  | Numeric credit score                   |
| `loan_approved` | Target variable (Yes / No)             |

> You can use `loan_data.csv` with dummy data or your own dataset.
